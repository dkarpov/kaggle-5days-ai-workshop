    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **\"Designing from Scratch\":** Generative AI models (like those used for creating images or text) are now being trained to design novel small molecules with specific desired properties. Instead of screening existing libraries, these AI systems can *invent* new molecular structures.\n",
      "*   **Optimizing for Efficacy and Safety:** These models can be guided to generate molecules that not only bind effectively to a target but also have favorable pharmacokinetic properties (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted) and reduced toxicity.\n",
      "*   **Example:** **Insilico Medicine** has been a prominent player here, using generative AI to design novel drug candidates for various indications, some of which have already entered clinical trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. AI for Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Finding New Life for Old Drugs:** AI can quickly analyze the vast amount of existing drug data and patient information to identify approved drugs that might be effective against new diseases.

      "*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can analyze patient data to identify biomarkers that predict who will respond best to a particular drug, enabling more targeted and successful clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **\"In Silico\" Trials:** While still nascent, there's research into using AI to simulate clinical trials virtually, reducing the need for some human participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. AI for Biologics and Peptide Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Beyond Small Molecules:** While much focus has been on small molecules, AI is also being applied to the discovery and design of larger molecules like antibodies, proteins, and peptides, which are increasingly important therapeutics.\n",
      "*   **Example:** AI can help design antibodies with improved binding affinity or reduced immunogenicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Companies and Initiatives in the Spotlight:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI and automation to map human cell biology and discover new drug targets and therapies.\n",

      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned, which is **Generative AI for Molecule Design**. This is a truly fascinating and rapidly evolving area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me elaborate:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is Generative AI in this Context?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of generative AI as AI that can **create something new**. In the context of drug discovery, it's not just about analyzing existing data, but about **designing and proposing entirely novel molecular structures** that have never been synthesized before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, drug discovery has relied on two main approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **High-Throughput Screening (HTS):** Testing millions of existing chemical compounds against a biological target to see if any \"hit.\"\n",
      "2.  **Rational Drug Design:** Using knowledge of the target's structure to design molecules that are likely to bind to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI offers a third, more proactive way: **generating optimal molecules from scratch.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**How it Works (Simplified):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Training Data:** Generative AI models are trained on vast datasets of known molecules, their chemical properties, and their biological activities. This teaches the AI the \"rules\" of chemistry and how molecular structures relate to function.\n",
      "2.  **Learning Molecular Representation:** The AI learns how to represent molecules in a way it can understand (e.g., as strings of characters called SMILES, or as graphs representing atoms and bonds).\n",
      "3.  **The Generative Process:** Once trained, the AI can be \"prompted\" to generate new molecules. This prompting can involve specifying desired properties, such as:\n",
      "    *   **Target Binding Affinity:** How strongly the molecule should bind to a specific disease target.\n",
      "    *   **Pharmacokinetic Properties (ADMET):**\n",
      "        *   **Absorption:** How well it's absorbed into the body.\n",
      "        *   **Distribution:** Where it travels in the body.\n",
      "        *   **Metabolism:** How it's broken down.\n",
      "        *   **Excretion:** How it's removed from the body.\n",
      "        *   **Toxicity:** How safe it is.\n",
      "    *   **Synthetic Tractability:** Whether the molecule can actually be synthesized in a lab.\n",
      "4.  **Iterative Refinement:** The generated molecules are then evaluated (often using predictive AI models or initial lab tests). The results of this evaluation are fed back into the generative AI, allowing it to refine its designs and generate even better molecules in subsequent rounds. This creates a powerful, iterative loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Advancements and Why it's Significant:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Exploring \"Uncharted Chemical Space\":** Generative AI can explore regions of chemical space that traditional methods might miss, potentially leading to breakthrough therapies for diseases that have been difficult to treat.\n",
      "*   **Designing for Multiple Properties Simultaneously:** Instead of optimizing for one property at a time (which can be a trade-off), generative AI can be designed to optimize for a combination of desired properties, leading to more \"drug-like\" candidates from the outset.\n",
      "*   **Speed and Efficiency:** The process of designing and identifying promising candidates can be dramatically accelerated compared to traditional methods.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** The molecules generated are often genuinely novel, meaning they are not simply variations of existing drugs, which can be crucial for overcoming resistance mechanisms or developing first-in-class therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples and Use Cases:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine:** As mentioned, they've been very public about using generative AI to design novel small molecules for indications like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cancer. They've had AI-designed drug candidates enter clinical trials relatively quickly.\n",
      "*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery, including generating novel molecules.\n",
      "*   **DeepMind (AlphaFold):** While primarily known for protein structure prediction, its advancements in understanding molecular structures are foundational for generative AI in drug design.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The \"Generative\" Aspect:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"generative\" part is key. It's not just finding the needle in a haystack; it's **building a better needle from the ground up** based on what a good needle should look like and do. This proactive design capability is what makes it so revolutionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "This development is still very much at the cutting edge, with ongoing research focused on improving the accuracy of property prediction, ensuring the synthetic feasibility of generated molecules, and integrating these AI tools even more tightly into the experimental workflow.\n",
      "\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n",
    "2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n",
    "3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n"
